      <h2>STILL ALIVE â€“ OUT NOW (June 2021)</h2>
      <p>Back in The BeforeTimes, we went into the studio and recorded five songs for an EP release. Then there was an interlude, best probably described as a hiatus, but now the time has come for this splendid recording to finally see the light of your ears.</p>
      <p>Huge thanks to His Holiness John Mitchell and all at <a href="https://outhousestudios.co.uk/">Outhouse Studios</a> for love, tea, wine, pain, joy and suffering, all in equal measure.</p>
